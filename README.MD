API → Azure Data Lake Pipeline

🧩 Use Case

This project demonstrates how to ingest live data from a public API (such as weather, currency, COVID-19, or cryptocurrency data) into Azure Data Lake using a robust ETL pipeline. The pipeline ensures fault-tolerant, incremental ingestion with proper handling of complex JSON data.

🛠️ Tools

Azure Data Factory (ADF) – REST connector for API ingestion

Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) – Data storage and staging

Databricks – Data transformation, JSON flattening, and incremental processing

✅ Features Implemented

API Pagination – Automatically retrieves all pages of data from the API.

Error Handling & Retries – Implements retry logic for failed requests.

JSON Flattening – Converts nested JSON responses into tabular format.

Incremental Ingestion – Only ingests new or updated data to minimize storage and processing time.
